<p class="marginal"><em>He capers, he dances, he has eyes of youth.</em>
<span>--Shakespeare / The Merry Wives of Windsor</span></p>

<h1>Capers!</h1>

<p>Play checkers against the computer and<br>study draughts games from books.</p>

<p class="marginal"><em>I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the
higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully
tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the elaborate
frivolity of Chess.</em> <span>--Poe / The Murders in the Rue
Morgue.</span></p>

<p>Its really more an office application than a game: a game would let the user
enter a small caf√©, and with the aid of a waiter, sit down at some table, join
a game, have a chat, get up, and settle on another table, to play another
opponent.</p>

<p>Still, capers tries its best, to give you a pleasant time with <em>Martin
Fierz'</em> strong checkers engines that search a given board for the 'best'
move.
Most commands are in the buttons, yet there are some more and powerful ones
hidden in the context-menu (right-mouse-click).</p>


<p>Capers is free software: you are invited to share and tinker. if in doubt,
see accompanying file COPYING for details on distribution and derivation.</p>


<h1>System requirements</h1>

<p>Capers depends on python and gtk, and pygtk, which glues
them together, version <em>2.4 of pygtk</em> at least;
also, it needs gnome canvas to display the board, and
python-ctypes, to talk to the engines.</p>

<p>It should work in most linux distributions, provided the
dependencies are met and sufficiently recent. It might also
work in Windows, if you manage to collect all the above
packages.</p>

<h1>Disclaimer</h1>

<ul>
<li>A game, for which there is no engine, cannot be played, as
capers does not know how to take pieces and crown kings - not
even for the English rules (that's different from Martin Fierz'
CheckerBoard).</li>

<li>Unlike earlier versions of capers, this one is made
with a toolkit. the python bindings make working with gtk
quite bearable. documentation is, except in parts, very clear
and accurate.</li>

<li>This follows the object oriented design. still, there are
just procedures. they are organised in classes, to not have to
come up with clever names for functions and globals, and to
more easily build on the fine work others have done.</li>

<li>No care has been taken to make the objects reusable
outside of this context. they all depend one on the other;
though most of the work gets done in the "game" class.</li>
</ul>
