Description: command line interface checkers
 .
 cliche is short for "command line interface checkers". it
 doesnt itself know how to play, but instead loads shared
 objects, that search a given board for valid/good moves.
 these modules have to conform to the API of Martin Fierz'
 CheckerBoard application.
